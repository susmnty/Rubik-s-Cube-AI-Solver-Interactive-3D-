# 🧠 Rubik's Cube AI Solver (Interactive 3D)

This project is a visual and interactive Rubik’s Cube AI solver built using **Streamlit** and **Three.js**. It includes a 3D Rubik’s Cube rendered in the browser and integrated with a backend model to perform moves based on AI predictions.

## 🚀 Features
- 🌐 Interactive 3D Rubik's Cube using Three.js
- 🔁 Simulated cube moves like "Front Clockwise", "Right Clockwise", etc.
- 🧠 Plug-and-play support for AI agent (DQN or others)
- 🖱️ User can manually trigger rotations from Streamlit UI
- 📦 Lightweight and works inside browser

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Three.js (3D rendering), JavaScript
- **Backend/UI**: Python, Streamlit
- **Optional AI**: PyTorch-based DQN (Deep Q-Network)
